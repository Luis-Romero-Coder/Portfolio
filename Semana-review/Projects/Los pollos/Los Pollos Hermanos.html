        <h2>Property</h2>
        <p>Gustavo owned fourteen Los Pollos restaurants in the American Southwest, specifically between Albuquerque and Nevada. (Mandala) (Bug) One of the restaurants in Albuquerque had several visitors related to Gus's business, notably Walter White, the Cousins, Mike Ehrmantraut, as well as Hank Schrader, who visited while investigating Fring.

When Gus needs to speak with one of his associates, he texts them "Pollos" to come to the restaurant or the factory farm. The restaurant employees are expected to answer the phone, mentioning the slogan: "Los Pollos Hermanos, where something delicious is always cooking." (Hermanos) Los Pollos Hermanos advertises their chickens as "slow-cooked to perfection... try it once and you'll know."</p>
